        - Aren't bees super cool?
        - I agree. In fact, we should learn more bees.
        - To do so, fly around the beehive and talk to the different bees frolicking around.
        - You can move using the WASD keys.
        - Interact with other bees using the ENTER key.
        - Each bee will tell you something very poggers about BEES!
